# Microsoft Intermediate Language - MSIL

* We can call it as Intermediate Language (IL) or Common Intermediate Language (CIL).

* During the compile time , the compiler convert the source code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).

* Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) is a CPU-independent set of instructions that can be efficiently converted to the native code. 

* During the runtime the Common Language Runtime (CLR)'s Just In Time (JIT) compiler converts the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) code into native code to the Operating System.

* When a compiler produces Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), it also produces Metadata. 
  * The Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and Metadata are contained in a portable executable (PE) file . 

* Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) includes instructions for loading, storing, initializing, and calling methods on objects, as well as instructions for arithmetic and logical operations, control flow, direct memory access, exception handling, and other operations


## Portable Executable (PE) File Format

* The Portable Executable (PE) format is a file format for executables, object code, and DLLs, used in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems.

* The PE file format was defined to provide the best way for the Windows Operating System to execute code and also to store the essential data which is needed to run a program. 

* Portable Executable File Format is derived from the Microsoft Common Object File Format (COFF).
